Use-case Scenario :

As a dedicated Cloud/DevOps administrator, you are responsible for meticulously monitoring and tracking all managed resources and providing a comprehensive report to your manager daily at precisely 7:30 PM. 

Manually running the script and generating the report can be challenging at times, so it is essential to automate this process.

AWS_Resource_Tracker.sh --> provides with script
Automating "AWS_Resource_Tracker.sh" --> provides with commands to automate the above script on timely basis
